# Weather Classification using Naive Bayes

This repository demonstrates Naive Bayes Classification on weather data to predict weather types (e.g., Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy).
The project covers the full machine learning workflow:

* Data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

* Feature encoding and scaling

* Training a Gaussian Naive Bayes model

* Model evaluation using accuracy, F1-scores, confusion matrix, and classification reports

* Visualization of prediction results compared to actual values
